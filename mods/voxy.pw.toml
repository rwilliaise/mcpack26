description = """Voxy is an LOD mod (like Distant Horizons) that lets you crank your render distant extremely high with little performance hit. Voxy is visually a little better than DH, and is nearly seamless (as in very hard to tell there are levels of detail at play). If your game crashes with this mod enabled, disable it and send the report to Callum--there's not a great way to have both DH and Voxy on one server, so if enough people cannot use Voxy we'd definitely want to switch back. Make sure your OpenGL drivers are AT LEAST 4.6."""
